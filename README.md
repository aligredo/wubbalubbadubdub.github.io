## Overview and Motivation 
The Android applications market has been very competetive with a lot of available applications in various categories. Therefore, it is very important to have full understanding of the market needs before developing an application. Our goal is to construct a business guideline for developing  an application and publishing it to the market which is the Google Play Store. Moreover, one of the most important reasons that inspired us to analyze the Google Android Store is that a member of the team is a game developer who has a game application published on Google Android Store and we were curious how could we reach highest success for this game application.
